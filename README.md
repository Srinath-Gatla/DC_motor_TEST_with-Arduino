# DC_motor_TEST_with-Arduino
This project demonstrates how to control the direction of a DC motor using an Arduino Uno and the L293D motor driver IC. The motor's rotation is controlled via two push buttonsâ€”one for forward rotation and one for reverse. The setup is ideal for basic robotics, motor control systems, or learning how to interface actuators with micro controllers.
